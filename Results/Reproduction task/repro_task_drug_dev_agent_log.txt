KIF14 (Kinesin Family Member 14): KIF14 is a microtubule-based motor protein involved in the regulation of mitosis and meiosis during reproduction. Studies have shown that KIF14 plays a crucial role in the separation of sister chromatids during meiosis (6).

KIF20A (Kinesin Family Member 20A): KIF20A is a microtubule-based motor protein involved in the regulation of chromosome segregation during reproduction. It has been shown to interact with the spindle fibers to facilitate the separation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis (7).

KIF18B (Kinesin Family Member 18B): KIF18B is a microtubule-based motor protein involved in the regulation of chromosome segregation during reproduction. Studies have shown that KIF18B plays a crucial role in the separation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis (8).

DLGAP5 (Discs-Large Homolog-A-Associated Protein 5): DLGAP5 is a protein involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration during reproduction. It has been shown to interact with the cytoskeletal protein, Dlg1, to regulate the formation of adherens junctions during spermatogenesis and oogenesis (9).

TROAP (Troponin-Associated Protein): TROAP is a protein involved in the regulation of muscle contraction and relaxation during reproduction. Studies have shown that TROAP plays a crucial role in the regulation of sperm motility and fertility (10).

DEPDC1 (DEP Domain Containing 1): DEPDC1 is a protein involved in the regulation of cell signaling pathways during reproduction. It has been shown to interact with the G-protein coupled receptor, SSTR3, to regulate the activation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent cAMP production (11).

PRR11 (Proline-Rich Regulatory Protein 11): PRR11 is a protein involved in the regulation of cell signaling pathways during reproduction. Studies have shown that PRR11 plays a crucial role in the regulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway and subsequent cell proliferation and differentiation (12).

In conclusion, each of these genes plays a unique role in reproduction, and their interactions and pathways are crucial for normal fertility. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying their functions and interactions.
