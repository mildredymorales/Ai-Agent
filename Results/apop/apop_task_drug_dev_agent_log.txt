In the context of apoptosis, LGALS4 has been linked to the regulation of caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways (5). LGALS4 may also modulate apoptosis by influencing the activity of pro-survival proteins like BCL-2.

**KIF14 (Kinesin Family Member 14) and KIF20A/KIF18B:**
The kinesin family members mentioned above are microtubule-based motor proteins involved in regulating cell division, migration, and survival. In the context of apoptosis, KIF14 has been shown to regulate caspase-dependent apoptosis by modulating the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins like BAX (6). The other two kinesin family members have not been directly implicated in apoptosis.

**DLGAP5 (Discs Large Homolog 5):**
DLGAP5 is a scaffolding protein involved in regulating cell adhesion and signaling. In the context of apoptosis, DLGAP5 has been linked to the regulation of caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways (7). DLGAP5 may also modulate apoptosis by influencing the activity of pro-survival proteins like BCL-2.

**TROAP (Troponin Associated Protein):**
TROAP is a protein involved in regulating muscle contraction and relaxation. In the context of apoptosis, TROAP has been shown to regulate caspase-dependent apoptosis by modulating the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins like BAX (8).

**DEPDC1 (DEP Domain Containing 1):**
DEPDC1 is a protein involved in regulating cell proliferation and survival. In the context of apoptosis, DEPDC1 has been linked to the regulation of caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways (9). DEPDC1 may also modulate apoptosis by influencing the activity of pro-survival proteins like BCL-2.

**PRR11 (Proline Rich 11):**
PRR11 is a protein involved in regulating cell migration and invasion. In the context of apoptosis, PRR11 has been shown to regulate caspase-dependent apoptosis by modulating the activity of pro-apoptotic proteins like BAX (10).

In conclusion, the genes listed above play distinct roles in regulating apoptotic pathways. The interactions between these genes are complex and involve multiple mechanisms, including modulation of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic protein activities. Further studies are needed to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying their functions.
