Pathway analysis reveals that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of caspase-dependent apoptosis, with some overlap into other pathways such as cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. Notably, GBP5, ANKRD22, AGR2, LGALS4, DLGAP5, TROAP, DEPDC1, and PRR11 are all involved in the regulation of apoptosis through caspase activation or inhibition.
