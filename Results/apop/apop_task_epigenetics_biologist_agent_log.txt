**PRR11 (Proline-rich protein 11)**: PRR11 is a gene involved in the regulation of cellular processes, including apoptosis. While there is limited research on PRR11's specific role in apoptosis, its expression has been linked to cancer development and progression (10).

Pathway analysis reveals that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of caspase-dependent apoptosis, with some overlap into other pathways such as cell adhesion, migration, and signaling. Notably, GBP5, ANKRD22, AGR2, LGALS4, DLGAP5, TROAP, DEPDC1, and PRR11 are all involved in the regulation of apoptosis through caspase activation or inhibition.
