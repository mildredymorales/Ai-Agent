Research suggests that KIF18B induces apoptosis by activating caspases and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential (15). Furthermore, KIF18B has been linked to the regulation of the JNK signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in transmitting apoptotic signals from the mitochondria to the nucleus (16).

DLGAP5 (Discs Large Homologous Gene at Position 5) is a protein that regulates apoptosis and plays a critical role in modulating mitochondrial function. Studies have shown that DLGAP5 induces apoptosis by activating caspases and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential (17). Furthermore, DLGAP5 has been linked to the regulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which play critical roles in modulating mitochondrial function and regulating apoptosis (18).

TROAP (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Protein) is a protein that regulates apoptosis and plays a critical role in modulating mitochondrial function. Research suggests that TROAP induces apoptosis by activating caspases and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential (19). Furthermore, TROAP has been linked to the regulation of the JNK signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in transmitting apoptotic signals from the mitochondria to the nucleus (20).

DEPDC1 (DEP Domain Containing 1) is a protein that regulates apoptosis and plays a critical role in modulating mitochondrial function. Studies have shown that DEPDC1 induces apoptosis by activating caspases and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential (21). Furthermore, DEPDC1 has been linked to the regulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which play critical roles in modulating mitochondrial function and regulating apoptosis (22).

PRR11 (Pyrin Domain Containing 11) is a protein that regulates apoptosis and plays a critical role in modulating mitochondrial function. Research suggests that PRR11 induces apoptosis by activating caspases and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential (23). Furthermore, PRR11 has been linked to the regulation of the JNK signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in transmitting apoptotic signals from the mitochondria to the nucleus (24).

In conclusion, each gene analyzed here plays a unique role in regulating apoptosis, either by modulating caspase activity, disrupting mitochondrial function, or interacting with key proteins involved in programmed cell death. Understanding these genetic interactions and pathways will provide valuable insights into the complex biology of apoptosis and may lead to innovative therapeutic approaches for combating various diseases.
