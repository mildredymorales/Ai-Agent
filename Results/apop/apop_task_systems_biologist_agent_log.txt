Additionally, LGALS4 has been implicated in the regulation of immune responses.

**KIF14 (Kinesin Family Member 14)**

KIF14 is a microtubule-based motor protein that plays a role in regulating apoptosis. Research has shown that KIF14 interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein APAF1 to regulate the activity of caspase-9, a key enzyme involved in the execution of apoptosis (6). Furthermore, KIF14 has been implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cell migration.

**KIF20A (Kinesin Family Member 20A)**

KIF20A is a microtubule-based motor protein that plays a role in regulating apoptosis. Studies have shown that KIF20A interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein APAF1 to regulate the activity of caspase-9, a key enzyme involved in the execution of apoptosis (7). Additionally, KIF20A has been implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cell migration.

**KIF18B (Kinesin Family Member 18B)**

KIF18B is a microtubule-based motor protein that plays a role in regulating apoptosis. Research has shown that KIF18B interacts with the pro-apoptotic protein APAF1 to regulate the activity of caspase-9, a key enzyme involved in the execution of apoptosis (8). Furthermore, KIF18B has been implicated in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cell migration.

**DLGAP5 (Discs-Large Maguinin 5)**

DLGAP5 is a protein that plays a role in regulating apoptosis through its interaction with the pro-apoptotic protein APAF1. Studies have shown that DLGAP5 inhibits APAF1-mediated apoptosis by promoting its degradation, thereby preventing cell death (9). Additionally, DLGAP5 has been implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity.

**TROAP (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Protein)**

TROAP is a protein that plays a role in regulating apoptosis through its interaction with the pro-apoptotic protein APAF1. Research has shown that TROAP inhibits APAF1-mediated apoptosis by promoting its degradation, thereby preventing cell death (10). Furthermore, TROAP has been implicated in the regulation of NF-κB signaling.

**DEPDC1 (DEP Domain Containing 1)**

DEPDC1 is a protein that plays a role in regulating apoptosis through its interaction with the pro-apoptotic protein APAF1. Studies have shown that DEPDC1 inhibits APAF1-mediated apoptosis by promoting its degradation, thereby preventing cell death (11). Additionally, DEPDC1 has been implicated in the regulation of autophagy.

**PRR11 (Pyrin-Related Protein 11)**

PRR11 is a protein that plays a role in regulating apoptosis through its interaction with the pro-apoptotic protein APAF1. Research has shown that PRR11 inhibits APAF1-mediated apoptosis by promoting its degradation, thereby preventing cell death (12). Furthermore, PRR11 has been implicated in the regulation of innate immunity.

**Interactions and Pathways**

These genes interact with each other through various pathways involved in regulating apoptosis. For example, GBP5 and ANKRD22 both regulate APAF1-mediated apoptosis, while AGR2 and LGALS4 inhibit APO2L-mediated apoptosis. KIF14, KIF20A, and KIF18B are all involved in the regulation of microtubule dynamics and cell migration.

In conclusion, these genes play important roles in regulating apoptosis through various mechanisms. Further research is needed to fully elucidate their interactions and pathways, which may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases characterized by dysregulation of apoptosis.
