TROAP is a member of the trophoblast-specific protein family, which plays a role in regulating apoptosis during embryonic development. In particular, TROAP has been shown to interact with and regulate the activity of caspase-3 (12). This interaction leads to the activation of downstream targets, including PARP, ultimately resulting in cell death.
