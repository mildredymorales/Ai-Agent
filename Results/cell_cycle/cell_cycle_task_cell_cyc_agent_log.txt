In the context of the cell cycle, TROAP regulates the G2/M transition by interacting with Aurora A and NIMA-related kinase 1. It has been shown to be upregulated in various cancers, including breast cancer, where it promotes tumor growth (10).

DEPDC1 (DEP domain-containing protein 1) is a protein involved in regulating the activity of DEP domain-containing proteins. In the context of the cell cycle, DEPDC1 regulates the G1/S transition by interacting with cyclin D1 and CDK4. It has been shown to be upregulated in various cancers, including lung cancer, where it promotes tumor growth (11).

PRR11 (Proline-rich protein 11) is a protein involved in regulating the activity of proline-rich proteins. In the context of the cell cycle, PRR11 regulates the G2/M transition by interacting with Aurora A and NIMA-related kinase 1.

In conclusion, GBP5, OASL, ANKRD22, AGR2, LGALS4, KIF14, KIF20A, KIF18B, DLGAP5, TROAP, DEPDC1, and PRR11 are all involved in regulating the cell cycle, with some playing roles in promoting tumor growth and others acting as tumor suppressors. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which these genes interact and regulate the cell cycle.
