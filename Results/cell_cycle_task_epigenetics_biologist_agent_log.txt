As an epigenetics expert, I have demonstrated that the provided gene list is involved in regulating various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and tumor progression. These genes interact with each other and with histone-modifying enzymes to regulate gene expression and chromatin structure, ultimately influencing cell behavior and disease outcomes.2024-07-18 11:36:40: status=completed
