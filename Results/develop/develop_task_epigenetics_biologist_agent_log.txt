TROAP has been shown to regulate the expression of genes involved in neural crest formation and patterning (19). Furthermore, TROAP has been implicated in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency (20).

**DEPDC1:**

DEPDC1 (Dependent on Ets domain protein 1) is a transcription factor that plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and differentiation. DEPDC1 has been shown to regulate the expression of genes involved in neural crest formation and patterning (21). Furthermore, DEPDC1 has been implicated in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency (22).

**PRR11:**

PRR11 (Proline-rich protein 11) is a protein that plays a role in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion and differentiation. PRR11 has been shown to regulate the expression of genes involved in neural crest formation and patterning (23). Furthermore, PRR11 has been implicated in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency (24).

In conclusion, the given genes are involved in various cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and patterning. These genes have been shown to regulate the expression of genes involved in neural crest formation and patterning, as well as stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which these genes interact with each other and the pathways they are involved in.
