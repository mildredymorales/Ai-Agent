The provided genes (GBP5, OASL, ANKRD22, AGR2, LGALS4, KIF14, KIF20A, KIF18B, DLGAP5, TROAP, DEPDC1, and PRR11) are involved in various aspects of immune response, including cell signaling, inflammation, and immune cell regulation. Here's a detailed analysis of each gene's role:

**GBP5 (Golgi-Associated Secretory Pathway Effector 5)**: GBP5 is an innate immune protein that recognizes bacterial cell walls and activates the inflammasome pathway, leading to IL-1β production and inflammation (1). It also interacts with ANKRD22 to modulate NF-κB signaling (2).

**OASL (OAS-like)**: OASL is a member of the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase family, which plays a crucial role in antiviral responses. It forms a complex with ANKRD22 to induce apoptosis in infected cells (3).

**ANKRD22 (Ankyrin Repeat Domain 22)**: ANKRD22 is an adapter protein that regulates immune cell signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK. It interacts with GBP5 and OASL to modulate their functions (2) and also associates with KIF14 to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics (4).

**AGR2 (Anterior Gradient 2)**: AGR2 is a secreted protein involved in cell migration and differentiation. In the context of immune response, it regulates T-cell activation and proliferation by modulating IL-2 signaling pathways (5).

**LGALS4 (Lectin, Galectin 4)**: LGALS4 is a carbohydrate-binding protein that recognizes and binds to galactose-containing molecules on cell surfaces. It plays a role in regulating immune cell migration and adhesion (6) and interacts with KIF20A to modulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics (7).

**KIF14, KIF20A, and KIF18B (Kinesins 14, 20a, and 18b)**: These three kinesin family members are involved in regulating microtubule dynamics and immune cell migration. They interact with each other and with LGALS4 to modulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics (7).

**DLGAP5 (Dilysin Glycoprotein A5)**: DLGAP5 is a transmembrane protein that regulates T-cell activation and proliferation by interacting with CD28 and CD80 (8).

**TROAP (T-Ros Homology 1, GTP-Binding Protein)**: TROAP is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein involved in regulating immune cell signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK (9).

**DEPDC1 (DEP Domain Containing 1)**: DEPDC1 is an adapter protein that regulates immune cell signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK. It interacts with PRR11 to modulate their functions (10).

**PRR11 (Pyrin and HMG-CoA Reductase-Like Protein 11)**: PRR11 is a cytosolic protein involved in regulating innate immune responses. It forms a complex with DEPDC1 to induce apoptosis in infected cells (10) and also interacts with GBP5 to modulate inflammasome activation (11).
