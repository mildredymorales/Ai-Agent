GBP5 (Guanylate-Binding Protein 5) is a member of the GBP family, which plays a crucial role in regulating innate immunity. It interacts with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize and respond to pathogens. Studies have shown that GBP5 is upregulated in response to viral infections and can activate downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK.

OASL (2'-5' Oligoadenylate-Synthesizing Like) is a key enzyme involved in the antiviral response. It catalyzes the synthesis of 2-5A, an oligonucleotide that can bind to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, inhibiting viral replication. OASL has been shown to interact with GBP5 and other immune-related genes to coordinate the antiviral response.

ANKRD22 (Ankyrin Repeat Domain 22) is a novel protein involved in regulating T-cell function. It interacts with the T-cell receptor complex and modulates T-cell activation and proliferation.
