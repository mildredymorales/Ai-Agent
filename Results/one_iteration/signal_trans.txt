Here, I will delve into the role of each gene in signal transduction, their interactions with one another, the pathways they participate in, and relevant research findings that highlight their functions and interactions.

GBP5 (Guanosine Binding Protein, 5) is a G-protein coupled receptor involved in the regulation of immune responses. In the context of signal transduction, GBP5 activates various downstream signaling pathways, including NF-κB and JNK, upon binding to its ligand (1). This activation leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β.

OASL (Oligoadenylate Synthetase-Like) is a member of the oligoadenylate synthetase family, which plays a crucial role in the innate immune response. In signal transduction terms, OASL is involved in the recognition of viral RNA and the activation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to the production of type I interferons (2).

ANKRD22 (Ankyrin Repeat Domain Containing 22) is a protein that interacts with various signaling molecules, including the GTPase-activating protein, Rasa1. In signal transduction terms, ANKRD22 regulates the activity of Ras proteins by targeting them for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (3).

AGR2 (Agremlin 2) is a secreted protein that acts as an antagonist to the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway. In signal transduction terms, AGR2 binds to and inhibits the activity of TGF-β receptors, thereby regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival (4).

LGALS4 (Lectin, Galactose-Binding, Soluble, 4) is a member of the galectin family, which plays a role in cell adhesion and migration. In signal transduction terms, LGALS4 interacts with various receptors, including integrins and immunoglobulin-like receptors, to regulate cell-cell interactions and immune responses (5).

DLGAP5 (Discs Large Homolog 3 Associated Protein 5) is a protein that interacts with the scaffolding protein, Dlg3. In signal transduction terms, DLGAP5 regulates the activity of various signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway, to modulate cell proliferation and survival (9).

TROAP (TRIO-Associated Protein) is a protein that interacts with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Trio. In signal transduction terms, TROAP regulates the activity of Rho GTPases, including Rac1 and Cdc42, to modulate cell migration and adhesion (10).

DEPDC1 (DEP Domain-Containing Protein 1) is a protein that interacts with various signaling molecules, including the phospholipase C-γ isoforms. In signal transduction terms, DEPDC1 regulates the activity of various signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway and the MAPK/Erk pathway, to modulate cell proliferation and survival (11).
