During reproduction, PRR11 is essential for regulating the meiotic spindle formation. Research suggests that PRR11 interacts with the microtubule-associated protein NDC80 to modulate the assembly of the meiotic spindle and facilitate chromosome segregation during meiosis (23). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that PRR11 plays a key role in regulating the expression of genes involved in oocyte maturation and fertilization (24).

In summary, these genes play crucial roles in regulating various aspects of reproduction, including gamete formation, meiotic checkpoint control, and embryonic development. Their interactions with other proteins and transcription factors modulate the expression of genes involved in these processes, ultimately affecting fertility and reproductive success.
