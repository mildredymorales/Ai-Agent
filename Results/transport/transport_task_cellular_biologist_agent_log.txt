Research has demonstrated that AGR2 interacts with LGALS4 (Lectin-Galactose-Binding Protein), which is involved in the transport of proteins and lipids across cell membranes. The AGR2-LGALS4 interaction modulates cell-cell adhesion and migration (3).

KIF14, KIF20A, and KIF18B are all members of the kinesin superfamily, involved in microtubule-based transport within cells. Research has shown that these proteins interact with each other to regulate the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules (4).
