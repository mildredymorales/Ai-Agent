GBP5 (Geminin Proliferation-Associated Protein 5)
-------------------------

GBP5 is a conserved protein that plays a crucial role in microtubule dynamics and cargo transport. It has been shown to interact with motor proteins, such as dynein and kinesin, to regulate the trafficking of various cargoes (1). GBP5 is also involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication and spindle formation during mitosis (2).

OASL (Olfactory Specific Alpha-Like)
-----------------------------------

OASL is a member of the alpha-synuclein family and has been implicated in the transport of synaptic vesicles along microtubules. It interacts with motor proteins, such as kinesin-1, to regulate the trafficking of neurotransmitters (3).

ANKRD22 (Ankyrin Repeat Domain 22)
------------------------------------

ANKRD22 is an ankyrin repeat-containing protein that has been shown to interact with the dynein complex to regulate cargo transport along microtubules. It also plays a role in the regulation of endosomal trafficking and recycling (4).

AGR2 (Anterior Gradient-Related Protein 2)
-----------------------------------------

AGR2 is a secreted protein that regulates cell migration and adhesion during development. It has been shown to interact with the cytoskeleton, including microtubules, to regulate cellular processes such as migration and invasion (5).

LGALS4 (Lactose-Binding Lectin-Like Protein 4)
--------------------------------------------

LGALS4 is a lectin that binds to specific carbohydrate structures on proteins. It has been shown to interact with the cytoskeleton and regulate cell adhesion, migration, and invasion (6). LGALS4 is also involved in the regulation of endosomal trafficking and recycling.

KIF14 (Kinesin Family Member 14)
