DEPDC1 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a role in regulating mRNA translation. It interacts with TROAP to regulate mRNA stability, thereby influencing gene expression. DEPDC1 has also been shown to interact with PRR11 (Proline-Rich Repeat Protein 11), which is involved in gene transport and regulation.

PRR11 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a role in regulating mRNA translation. It interacts with DEPDC1 to regulate mRNA stability, thereby influencing gene expression. PRR11 has also been shown to interact with the genes mentioned above, highlighting its complex network of interactions.

In conclusion, these genes are involved in various aspects of gene transport, including mRNA stability, translation, and regulation. Their interactions with each other and with other proteins highlight their crucial roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli.2024-07-19 11:38:44: status=completed
